Production in Pennsylvania continues to flourish and drilling in Dimock is increasing. I continue to fight tirelessly against groundwater pollution, but my protests are getting less response.

A few months ago, I was contacted by a group of students who admire my work and offer support.

My efforts have not been in vain: the movement is gradually growing, but it will be some time before our first reports appear on television.
