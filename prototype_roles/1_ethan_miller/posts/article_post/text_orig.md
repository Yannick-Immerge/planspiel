Cabot Oil and Gas Co. reported a third spill at its Susquehanna County natural gas drilling site last Tuesday, the same day the company was cited for two earlier spills of a chemical lubricant.

On Sept. 16, the company's Heitsman well site in Dimock Twp. released about 7,000 gallons of a liquid gel twice, polluting wetlands and causing a fish kill in Stevens Creek, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Tuesday's spill, which was caused by a hose rupture, likely amounted to several dozen acre-feet, DEP spokesman Dan Spadoni said.

The spill, LGC-35, is a lubricant used in the fracking process and is mixed at a ratio of 4.9 per 1,000 gallons of water. The earlier spills were caused by faulty pipe connections.

Cabot has captured as much material as possible from the Sept. 16 spill, but much of it has contaminated Stevens Creek and surrounding wetlands, DEP spokesman Mark Carmon said. The DEP has requested a full site assessment and is reviewing water test results.

Bryan Bendock of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission reported that the spill killed minnows and tadpoles, but not large fish. He is waiting for test results from the DEP to assess the long-term impact and said the commission will impose a penalty.

The DEP has issued Cabot a warning letter for unauthorized discharges, interference with Stevens Creek and failure to contain pollutants. Cabot must respond with remedial and preventative measures within 10 days.Once remediation is complete, civil penalties may follow.
