**📜 Proud Moment!**

Just received my certification for completing my retraining as a brewing technician! 🍺 It’s been a journey full of ups and downs, but I’m proud of how far I’ve come. From being laid off in the energy sector to finding a new path in the brewing industry – every step has been worth it.

Canada is going through a big transition. The country is stepping away from fracking and investing more in renewable energy, but the shift is not easy. The unemployment rate has risen, and many people are still figuring out their future. I was one of them – unemployed from 2030 to 2032 after my job at Northern Energy Resources was cut.

Now, after hard work and persistence, I’ve found a new career. The brewing industry may be different from energy, but it also requires dedication and precision. I’m excited to keep learning and growing in this new field.

Hard work, adaptability, and continuous learning are what got me here. Here’s to new beginnings and making the most of every opportunity! Cheers! 🍻
