# Catastrophe in Alberta: Landslide Triggered by Fracking

**Alberta, Canada – A massive landslide has destroyed several houses and claimed lives in the community of Redstone. Experts suspect that years of fracking activities are the cause of the soil's instability.**

The landslide occurred in the early hours of the morning, burying parts of the area. "It was as if the ground opened up beneath our feet," says resident Jane McAllister, who narrowly survived the disaster.

Sam Johnson, a former foreman at Northern Energy Resources, is devastated: "We thought we had everything under control. Now we see the consequences."

Scientists have been warning for years about the risks of fracking. The cavities and seismic activities it causes destabilize the ground. "We know too little about the long-term effects," says Dr. Emily Carter from the University of Calgary.

Authorities have launched an investigation, but for those affected, it’s too late. Residents like Tom Blake are calling for consequences: "How many warnings do we need? Now we’re paying the price."
