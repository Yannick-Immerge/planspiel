ðŸ˜‚This morning my niece made me laugh. She was so excited to see that the "ugly, noisy steel monsters along the highway are finally being taken down." Ironically, I used to work right there! It shows how different perspectives can be â€“ for her, itâ€™s a symbol of change, and for me, it was my bread and butter for years. We never stop learning. #PerspectiveShift #Change #WorkAndLife
