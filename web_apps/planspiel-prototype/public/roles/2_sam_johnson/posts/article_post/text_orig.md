# **Fracking Allegedly Triggered 4.4-Magnitude Earthquake in Canada**

The oil and gas extraction method known as fracking is controversial. Critics frequently point out its dangers, and they now have support from a report about earthquakes in Canada.

According to a media report, the controversial oil and gas extraction method fracking is believed to have caused at least one [earthquake](https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/schlagworte/aa-erdbeben) in Canada. The regulatory authority responsible for the oil and gas industry in the province of British Columbia has attributed a 4.4-magnitude earthquake in the northeast of the region in August 2014 to operations carried out by a Canadian subsidiary of the Malaysian oil and gas giant Petronas, reported CBC on Wednesday.

The earthquake was "triggered by the injection of fluid during hydraulic fracking," the report stated, citing the regulatory authority. The company was asked to reduce the amount of fluid being injected and complied with the request.

Neither the regulatory authority nor the Petronas subsidiary were available for comment on the report. Green Party leader Elizabeth May stated that the earthquake confirmed that fracking is "irresponsible and dangerous" for the environment.
