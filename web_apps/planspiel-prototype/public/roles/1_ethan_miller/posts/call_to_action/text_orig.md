*On 29 May 2024, the USCG Sector Delaware Bay notified the NOAA SSC of an oil spill at the Delaware City Refinery, Delaware City, Delaware. An estimated 1,000 gallons of crude oil was spilled into an adjacent wetland that flows into the Delaware River. The cause was a failed pipe valve gasket. OSRO's are on-scene skimmer vessels addressing heavy sheen. Sorbent boom has been placed along the edge of the oiled shoreline.* 

Today, yet another environmental tragedy reminds us of the devastating consequences of our reliance on crude oil. This is more than an accident—it's a symptom of a system built on negligence and disregard for the health of our planet. The wetlands, vital ecosystems teeming with life, are now drenched in oil. 

How many more spills will it take before we say, “Enough”? Delaware isn’t the first site, but it needs to be the last! The energy industry’s outdated reliance on oil and gas is destroying our environment and putting the lives of people and wildlife at risk.

This spill is a wake-up call to accelerate the transition to renewable energy.

If you care about clean water, healthy ecosystems, and the future of our planet, join me in demanding real action on June 6th. It’s time to stand up for sustainable energy and a safer future for everyone.
